                </div>
                <p>Bitter foods all contain liver-boosting nutrients such as sulfur, along with fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). These are necessary for the body to be able to produce bile, which is needed for optimal digestion and to help the liver work at prime level. <br> For your liver to work its best to filter out the bad stuff, it needs to produce bile. Think of it like a muscle; if it’s not being worked, it’s not giving you many (if any) benefits which help not only cleanse the system but also balance cravings for sweet foods. <br> When you regularly consume bitter foods with other healthy plant-based foods in your diet, you’ll likely notice that your body might start to feel more balanced nature created them for a reason..</p>
